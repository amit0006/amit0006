👋 Hi, I’m Amit Kumar Thakur

💻 I’m a tech enthusiast, full-stack developer, and problem solver passionate about building real-world solutions that combine software, AI/ML, and IoT.

🚀 What I do:

🖥️ Backend & Frontend Development – Built logistics apps (vehicle booking, billing, refunds) and a healthcare platform (Jivika) with FastAPI + React, including doctor booking, video consultations, and chatbot features.

🤖 AI & OCR Applications – Worked on VTU result extraction using OCR models (Doctr, Donut, Gemma), automating student marks → Excel with smart formatting (fail subjects 🔴).

📡 IoT & Embedded Systems – Explored RFID attendance systems, smart shoes/exoskeletons, and sensor applications (GPS, piezoelectric, load cells, temperature, etc.).

📊 Data & Tools – Customized Power BI dashboards (dark mode ✨) and mastered Linux permissions (chmod).

🌍 Social Impact Projects – Focused on education, healthcare, and safety: RFID attendance in rural schools, doctor-at-doorstep services, and innovative ideas to prevent violence in public spaces.

🔥 What drives me:
I love pushing beyond “traditional” solutions, blending innovation + tech to solve meaningful problems. From AI-powered OCR to IoT wearables, I thrive on projects that bring real impact.

🌟 Always learning. Always building. Always solving.
